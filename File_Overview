CI Plant Animals Project
Goal: Examine the relationship between carbon storage and terrestrial vertebrate diversity at 14 TEAM sites
Specifically, model animal diversity as a function of site characteristics (plants, elevation, precipitation, latitude):
    Bird and/or Mammal Sp. Richness ~ Carbon + Plants + Elevation + Precipitation + Latitude + Interactions
    Bird and/or Mammal Taxonomic Diversity ~ Carbon + Plants + Elevation + Precipitation + Latitude + Interactions
    Bird and/or Mammal Functional Diversity ~ Carbon + Plants + Elevation + Precipitation + Latitude + Interactions

CARBON & PLANT CALCULATIONS
Run PlantDiversity.R to calculate plant covariates. 
  These include stem density, genus richness, genus diversity for trees and lianas
  Functional diversity (wood density and max genus diameter) for trees
  Carbon storage for trees

ANIMAL SPECIES RICHNESS ESTIMATES
Run RichnessLoop.R
*RichnessLoop.R requires manual specification of whether to limit analysis to AVES and/or MAMMALIA
  Multiple points at which specification is required are indicated by the full line of # symbols.
Note that non-looping models for a single site can be run with file EstimateSpeciesRichness.R

ANIMAL FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY CALCULATIONS
Load FunctionalTrait_HelperFunctions.R 
Run WPI_Extraction.R to obtain species and site specific occupancy probabilities to use as abundance weights
Run FunctionalDiversity.R to calculate animal functional diversity metrics. 
*FunctionalDiversity.R requires some manual operation for data extraction.
  Line 100: Designate site and year for data.use object
  Line 155-195: Save site specific output individually

ANIMAL TAXONOMIC RICHNESS CALCULATIONS

MODELING & CALCULATIONS FOR ELEVATION, PRECIPITATION & LATITUDE 
Run file PlantAnimalModeling.R
Note that CT elevation code may need to be re-worked (renaming of objects in RichnessLoop.R from EstimateSpeciesRichness.R)
Note that models are not finalized and require manual operation
